# ðŸ¤– Wargaming Task Notifier Discord Bot

A Discord bot that automatically checks for new tasks in Wargaming's Backend SWE Course platform and notifies a specified Discord channel when new tasks become available for students to attempt.

This project idea came to me after I wanted to somehow get notified for when the tutors of the course added a new task on the platform so I can go ahead and complete it.

## Features

- ðŸ”„ Automatically checks for new course tasks every 10 minutes
- ðŸ”” Posts notifications to your Discord channel when new tasks are found
- ðŸ’¾ Keeps track of previously seen tasks to avoid duplicate notifications
- ðŸ¤– Command-based interaction to view all current tasks
